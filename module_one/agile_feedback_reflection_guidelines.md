# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 

waterfall is a cool way to make lots of money, agile works if you want repeat customers.

2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?
Knowing that I wouldn't really be able to help much with the project I just tried to be available whenever so that we could work driver/navigator so that I might be able to learn something.

3. What role did you take on in the project? 
I tried to help in anyway I could, my contributions were mostly finding typos and syntax errors.

4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
I just wish I had a better grasp of the fundementals, I think that because I didnt have as much of a foundation my attempts to learn werent as effective. I cant figure out the fourth thing if im still not sure about the second thing.

5. How does retro function in a team project?

I think with anything its good to have some retrospection, in the moment things seem one way but after you get away from something for a while the fog lifts and you can maybe see things from an outside perspective.

6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?
I didnt worry about giving any 'violent feedback' because im aware I have no business telling anyone anything.

7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
I think im a good communicator, I could be wrong though.
